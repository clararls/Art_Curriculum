Hi 👋!! My name is Clara and I (as many of us) tried a few times learn how to draw properly, unsuccesfully. So I'm going to compile the new courses, videos to improve the information provided in the Art curriculum Solo Artist,based on the free document he provide on his [gumroad](https://alexhuneycutt.gumroad.com/l/free_curriculum) and on the 
[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/), but with my touch. 

If you want a more visual and easy access to the old data you have [here](https://www.soloartcurriculum.com/) this amazing page, made by [Brendan Meachen](https://www.brendanmeachen.com/)

Forked from [Art_Curriculum](https://github.com/StephanRaab/Art_Curriculum). Also I will colour code each term and unit so that everyone has access to its status.

# Extra Term 0 ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-2ECC71)
Sometimes we feel like our level is bellow than the exercises on the first term, but is only a matter of seeing some kind of improvement. So I leave here a few resources that help me to build confidence.
