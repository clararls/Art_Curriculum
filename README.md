Hi ðŸ‘‹!! My name is Clara and I (as many of us) tried a few times learn how to draw properly, unsuccesfully. So I'm going to compile the new courses, videos to improve the information provided in the Art curriculum Solo Artist,based on the free document he provide on his [gumroad](https://alexhuneycutt.gumroad.com/l/free_curriculum) and on the 
[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/), but with my touch. 

If you want a more visual and easy access to the old data you have [here](https://www.soloartcurriculum.com/) this amazing page, made by [Brendan Meachen](https://www.brendanmeachen.com/)

Forked from [Art_Curriculum](https://github.com/StephanRaab/Art_Curriculum). Also I will colour code each term and unit so that everyone has access to its status.

Disclaimer: I am no art expert. I'm adding what's from RadioRunner and from my experience, so if anyone knows of a good free resource, please create a pull request and I will add it. Thanks !!
## Important
The recommended time to complete this curriculum is spend 4 weeks per unit

# Extra: Term 0 ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-2ECC71)
Sometimes we feel like our level is bellow than the exercises on the first term, but is only a matter of seeing some kind of improvement. So I leave here a few resources that help me to build confidence.

> Check and do the excersices from videos then if you want, lesson 1 till lesson 7 from the book, but feel free to continue as you want, if not, go to Term 1.

# Term 1 ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-2ECC71)

## U1 Figure Drawing 1 
Do the gesture challenge concurrently with the figure drawing course. In the early stages, learning the flow of gesture is the most important thing - it prevents stiffness in your drawings

- [ðŸ“¼ Love Life Drawing: Figuary](https://www.lovelifedrawing.com/figuary/) -- Love Life Drawing have put together a FREE ten-day challenge [Fresh Eyes Challenge](https://community2.lovelifedrawing.com/c/fresh-eyes/) but need to register to access.

- [ðŸ’° Figure Drawing Fundamentals (Proko Premium)](https://www.proko.com/figure-drawing-fundamentals-course/)

> Challenge: 30 days of gesture sessions with [croquis cafe](https://vimeo.com/croquiscafe) and/or [draw this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOVNvkn-f6BW18AvplWI8YA)

> Alternative: 30 days of a series of short poses as follows: three 1 minute poses, two 2 minute poses, one 5 minute pose per day, you can use [Line of Action](https://line-of-action.com/practice-tools/app#/figure-drawing) or [SketchDaily](https://www.sketchdaily.net/) those are free reference sites with timers.

## U2 Perspective 1 
Drawabox is a (very) dense course, and important for your foundation in draftsmanship. The recommended order would be **Lesson 1**, **250 box challenge**, then into **Lesson 2** and when you get on the **Texture and Detail** part, go and do the **25 textures challenge** *at the same time*, but one row at the time. I also added a quick video to understand perspective, but watch it when you get to lesson 1.

## U3 Composition and storytelling 1
Just more a theorical unit, before jumping directly into next term. Sycra's video on "iterative Drawing" is a great one to learn how to challenge yourself to create variations - whether they're good or bad.
